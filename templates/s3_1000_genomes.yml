  description: |
    The 1000 Genomes Project is an international collaboration which has established the most detailed catalogue of human genetic variation,
    including SNPs, structural variants, and their haplotype context. The final phase of the project sequenced more than 2500 individuals
    from 26 different populations around the world and produced an integrated set of phased haplotypes with more than 80 million variants for these individuals.
