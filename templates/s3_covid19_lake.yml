  name: COVID-19 Data Lake
  description: |
    A centralized repository of up-to-date and curated datasets on or related to 
    the spread and characteristics of the novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) and its 
    associated illness, COVID-19. Globally, there are several efforts underway to 
    gather this data, and we are working with partners to make this crucial data 
    freely available and keep it up-to-date. Hosted on the AWS cloud, we have 
    seeded our curated data lake with COVID-19 case tracking data from Johns 
    Hopkins and The New York Times, hospital bed availability from Definitive 
    Healthcare, and over 45,000 research articles about COVID-19 and related 
    coronaviruses from the Allen Institute for AI.
