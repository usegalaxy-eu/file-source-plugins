  name: NOAA Unified Forecast System Subseasonal to Seasonal Prototype 5
  description: |
    The Unified Forecast System Subseasonal to Seasonal prototypes consist of 
    reforecast data from the UFS atmosphere-ocean coupled model experimental 
    prototype version 5, 6, 7, and 8 produced by the Medium Range and Subseasonal 
    to Seasonal Application team of the UFS-R2O project. The UFS prototypes are 
    the first dataset released to the broader weather community for analysis and 
    feedback as part of the development of the next generation operational numerical 
    weather prediction system from NWS. The datasets includes all the major weather 
    variables for atmosphere, land, ocean, sea ice, and ocean waves.
    Acknowledgment - The Unified Forecast System (UFS) atmosphere-ocean coupled 
    model experimental version # data used in this study are made available through 
    the UFS Research to Operations (UFS-R2O) project sponsored by the National 
    Weather Service (NWS) Office of Science and Technology Integration (OSTI) 
    Modeling Program Division and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
