  name: NOAA Global Forecast System (GFS)
  description: |
    The Global Forecast System (GFS) is a weather forecast model produced by the 
    National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). Dozens of atmospheric 
    and land-soil variables are available through this dataset, from temperatures, 
    winds, and precipitation to soil moisture and atmospheric ozone concentration. 
    The entire globe is covered by the GFS at a base horizontal resolution of 18 
    miles (28 kilometers) between grid points, which is used by the operational 
    forecasters who predict weather out to 16 days in the future. Horizontal 
    resolution drops to 44 miles (70 kilometers) between grid points for forecasts 
    between one week and two weeks.
