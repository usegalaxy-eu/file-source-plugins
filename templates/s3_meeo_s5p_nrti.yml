description: |
    This data set consists of observations from the Sentinel-5 Precursor 
    (Sentinel-5P) satellite of the European Commissionâ€™s Copernicus Earth 
    Observation Programme. Sentinel-5P is a polar orbiting satellite that 
    completes 14 orbits of the Earth a day. It carries the TROPOspheric 
    Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) which is a spectrometer that senses 
    ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS), near (NIR) and short wave infrared 
    (SWIR) to monitor ozone, methane, formaldehyde, aerosol, carbon monoxide, 
    nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere. The satellite was 
    launched in October 2017 and entered routine operational phase in March 
    2019. Data is available from July 2018 onwards.
