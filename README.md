# file-source-plugins

A resource of pluggable Galaxy file source plugins.

The file [file_sources_conf.yml](./file_sources_conf.yml) can be used to integrate file sources for all users by default.
The files in the [templates](./templates) folder can be used to populate a `config/file_source_templates.yml` file.
In that case, the file source plugins are not activated by default for each user, but they can be activated in each user-preferences.
